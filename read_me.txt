This is a skeleton AI_Framework and can be modified and extended for your own use case.
Open the "config.py" file and add your OPEN AI_API KEY - this keeps it seperate from the main file and not hard coded into any module.
The config file can be modified to use another AI model and API Key including free open source LLM's.
